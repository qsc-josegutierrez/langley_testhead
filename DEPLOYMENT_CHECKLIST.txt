================================================================================
                     DEPLOYMENT CHECKLIST
================================================================================

PRE-DEPLOYMENT (On Development PC)
-----------------------------------
[ ] All configuration files (.xlsx or .json) are in config\ folder
[ ] Tested with: python testhead_control.py <args>
[ ] Run build_exe.bat successfully
[ ] Tested executable: dist\testhead_control.exe <args>
[ ] Verified output shows "command_success: True"

PACKAGING
---------
[ ] Zip or copy entire dist\ folder
[ ] Include these files in deployment package:
    - testhead_control.exe
    - config\ folder with all .xlsx/.json files
    - (Optional) drivers\ folder with AIOUSB.dll
    - README.txt
    - QUICK_START.txt

TARGET PC REQUIREMENTS
----------------------
[ ] Windows 7 or later
[ ] ACCESIO USB DIO board connected
[ ] EEPROM board ID matches config HEXADDRESS
[ ] AIOUSB.dll available (System32 or drivers\ folder)

INSTALLATION ON TARGET PC
--------------------------
[ ] Copy dist\ folder to target PC (e.g., C:\TestHead\)
[ ] Install AIOUSB.dll:
    [ ] Option 1: Copy to C:\Windows\System32\
    [ ] Option 2: Create drivers\ subfolder and place there
[ ] Test connection: Run any testhead command
[ ] Verify hardware responds correctly

CONFIGURATION MANAGEMENT
-------------------------
[ ] Document which config file is for which testhead model
[ ] Keep master configs in version control
[ ] Update HEXADDRESS if board ID changes
[ ] Test new configs before deploying

ADDING NEW CONFIGURATIONS (ON DEV PC)
--------------------------------------
For Excel:
[ ] Create/edit .xlsx file with DIO_List and command sheets
[ ] Save to config\ folder
[ ] Rebuild executable: build_exe.bat
[ ] Test new config

For JSON:
[ ] Copy config\testhead_config_template.json
[ ] Edit with your DIO_List and commands
[ ] Save to config\ folder
[ ] Rebuild executable: build_exe.bat
[ ] Test new config

ADDING NEW CONFIGURATIONS (ON TARGET PC)
-----------------------------------------
Without rebuilding:
[ ] Copy new .xlsx or .json file to dist\config\ folder
[ ] Test with: testhead_control.exe <new_config> <sheet> <dio> <path>

VALIDATION TESTS
----------------
[ ] Test "Initialize Testhead, Clear ALL" - should reset all lines
[ ] Test specific command - verify hardware responds
[ ] Test with wrong config - should show clear error message
[ ] Test with disconnected hardware - should show device not found error

TROUBLESHOOTING ON TARGET PC
-----------------------------
If "AIOUSB.dll not found":
[ ] Check C:\Windows\System32\AIOUSB.dll exists
[ ] Or check drivers\AIOUSB.dll exists
[ ] Try copying DLL to same folder as .exe

If "Config file not found":
[ ] Verify file is in config\ subfolder
[ ] Check filename spelling (case-sensitive)
[ ] Try using full path to config file

If "Device not found":
[ ] Check USB cable connection
[ ] Verify device in Windows Device Manager
[ ] Check HEXADDRESS matches board EEPROM ID
[ ] Try different USB port
[ ] Restart PC

If "Command not found":
[ ] Check PathName spelling in config file
[ ] Verify sheet name is correct
[ ] Path components are joined with ", " (comma-space)

MAINTENANCE
-----------
[ ] Keep backup of working configurations
[ ] Document any custom commands or modifications
[ ] Test after Windows updates
[ ] Periodically verify hardware connections

SUPPORT CONTACTS
----------------
Developer: [Your name/team]
Hardware: ACCESIO support
Config Location: [Path to master configs]
